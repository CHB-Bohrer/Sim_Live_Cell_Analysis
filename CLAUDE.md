# Sim_Live_Cell_Analysis

Repo for validating live-cell microscopy analysis of chromatin loci against simulations with known ground truth.
Package name: `simlive` (src layout). Owner is a biophysicist; experiment details (loci labeled, modality, frame rate,
what the analysis measures) are **not yet specified** — ask before building stages 2+ beyond stubs.

## Environment
- Windows 11, NVIDIA RTX 3090 (driver supports CUDA 13.2). Conda env `simlive` from `environment.yml`, Python 3.12
  (Trackastra supports 3.10–3.13, Ultrack 3.11–3.13).
- OpenMM CUDA build (conda-forge), PyTorch CUDA wheels (pip), CuPy, polychrom (installed from GitHub, not PyPI), Trackastra.
- The one GPU is shared: OpenMM (stage 1) and PyTorch (stage 4). Run them sequentially, never concurrently.
- Verify setup with `pytest -m gpu`.
- Always run Python through `scripts\run.cmd` (activates the env). Calling the env's python.exe directly fails on
  DLL loading.
- Never import torch into the Streamlit dashboard (`app/dashboard.py`): on Windows it clashes with the plotting libs'
  OpenMP runtime and kills the server. The dashboard shells out to `scripts/run_tracking_demo.py` instead.
- Cellpose runs in a separate worker process (`stage4_segtrack/cellpose_worker.py`) with `skimage` import blocked:
  importing Cellpose after torch otherwise aborts with "OMP: Error #15" (two OpenMP runtimes). Do NOT use
  KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK to work around it (can silently give wrong results). Same rule for any new torch-based tool
  that also pulls in scikit-image: isolate it in its own process.
- `scripts/sweep.py` runs grids x seeds and writes `data/sweeps/<name>/results.csv`. Single runs are not evidence;
  compare conditions over >=5 seeds (seed-to-seed sd of ID switches is large, ~5-10).
- polychrom is installed WITHOUT its Cython extension (`scripts/install_polychrom.ps1`); do not use knot-simplification
  functions.
- Current state: stages 2, 3 (nuclear channel only), 4 (threshold-watershed segmentation + Trackastra) and 7a
  (CTC metrics + identity switches) exist; stage 1 (chromatin), locus channels, stage 5, 6 and 7b do not.
  `src/simlive/pipelines/tracking_demo.py` chains them; `app/dashboard.py` is the UI.

## Pipeline stages (each is its own subpackage under `src/simlive/`)
1. `stage1_chromatin` — polychrom/OpenMM polymer dynamics -> locus-locus distances vs time (polymer units).
2. `stage2_cells` — multiple cells with persistent IDs, diffusive/directed motion, collisions, optional division.
   Motion is applied *afterward* to saved chromatin coordinates.
3. `stage3_microscopy` — forward model: PSF, exposure blur, camera noise, photon counts, photobleaching, frame rate,
   localization error. Renders locus channel + nuclear/cell channel + per-cell ground-truth label masks.
4. `stage4_segtrack` — segmentation (Cellpose or StarDist) and tracking. Tracker sits behind a swappable adapter
   (`Tracker` protocol); Trackastra first, Ultrack and TrackMate later, all on identical synthetic data.
5. `stage5_linking` — link locus tracks to tracked cells.
6. `stage6_analysis` — the user's analysis pipeline (TBD).
7. `stage7_validation` — ground-truth comparison: tracking metrics (Cell Tracking Challenge: DET, TRA, LNK, etc.)
   and propagation of tracking errors into locus-distance results.
- `calibration` — converts polymer units to nm and seconds by matching locus MSD to measured values.
- `io` — shared readers/writers and schema definitions for stage interchange files.

## Tracking evaluation protocol
Run the tracker twice: (a) on ground-truth masks (isolates linking error), (b) on automatic-segmentation masks
(realistic). Score both against true cell IDs.

## Conventions
- **File contracts:** each stage reads and writes defined files only (no in-memory hand-offs between stages).
  Every stage output directory contains: data files, `params.yaml` (resolved config), `seed.txt`, `provenance.json`
  (git commit, package versions, timestamp), and ground truth where applicable.
- **Run layout:** `data/runs/<run_id>/stageN_<name>/...`. `run_id` encodes the config hash + seed. Outputs are
  gitignored; they must be reproducible from config + seed.
- **Configs:** YAML in `configs/`, one per stage plus sweep files that expand to a list of resolved configs.
  Never hardcode parameters in code.
- **Seeds:** all randomness flows from an explicit seed via `numpy.random.default_rng` (and `torch` / OpenMM seeds
  set from it). Derive per-stage/per-cell seeds with `SeedSequence.spawn`, never reuse global state.
- **Units:** stage 1 in polymer units; calibrated physical units (nm, s) from stage 2 onward. Name columns/vars with
  units (`x_nm`, `t_s`). Calibration parameters are recorded in the run.
- **Formats:** trajectories and tables as HDF5 or Parquet/CSV with a documented schema; images as TIFF/zarr; label
  masks as integer arrays whose value is the persistent cell ID.
- **Tests:** pytest, in `tests/`. GPU tests marked `@pytest.mark.gpu`. Prefer small deterministic tests with a
  known analytic answer (e.g. free diffusion MSD).
- Python 3.12, type hints on public functions, no wildcard imports.
